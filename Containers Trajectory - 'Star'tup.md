# Containers Trajectory - 'Star'tup

## Introduction

This notebook is writing for record and manage my *Container Technology* learning process. The reasons for doing this seemingly unavailing work are listed below:

+ **My FAQs**: <u>Problems</u> recorded here would make a proper reinstall easier for me.
+ **Knowledge Containers & Clusters**: <u>Knowledge</u> should be organized for future requirements.
+ **IDEAs**: Writing a technical git*(book or something maybe never be glanced at) could be a method to express  creative ideas that may seldom notice in daily work as well as get vigorous inspiration.
+ **Skills Practice**: Just do some practice in Markdown and English Writing.
+ **Personal Reason**: Just for fun.
